# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

## Description

<p>Given a string <code>s</code>, find the length of the <strong>longest substring</strong> without repeating characters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;abcabcbb&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is &quot;abc&quot;, with the length of 3.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;bbbbb&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is &quot;b&quot;, with the length of 1.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;pwwkew&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is &quot;wke&quot;, with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, &quot;pwke&quot; is a subsequence and not a substring.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.</li>
</ul>

## Iterative solution

I am using an approach called a 'sliding window.' Each character is added to the window and we keep track of the longest window length. If the character is already found in the window, we remove every character up to and including the character in the window. That is how the uniqueness of the characters is ensured.

Here is the code:

```ts
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: string): number {
  if (s.length < 2) return s.length;

  let test = '',
    max = 0;

  for (const c of s) {
    if (test.includes(c)) test = test.substring(test.indexOf(c) + 1);

    test += c;
    max = Math.max(max, test.length);
  }

  return max;
}
```
